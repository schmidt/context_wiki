RMQL
====

RMQL is a simple query language that allows to create queries on a specific rails model. The advantage of this approach is on the one hand the ease of use and on the other hand it allows the application developer to create queries to the application that only return what the end user wants to see.

The intended target system for this plugin are applications, that want to open up there application model to external users to create mash-ups using the RMQL language.<br>


RMQL by example
===============

At first assume, that you have a certain model in place. This model is now called User. This model is defined and used as usual in your rails application.


TODO:
================
* add rule to grammar that allows
  <user>{#variable}<nested>{content}</nested></user>  
* what about subselects in where condition?
* write blog article about read/write_inheritable_attribute extension
  of rails    
* what about variables in normal strings
* rewrite parser here parser should have less keywords
